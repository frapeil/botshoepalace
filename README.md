/*
 * Selenium based script | https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium
 * Why is this open sourced?
 * - Anyone with a brain cell can make a selenium script.
 * - If I sold this script and knew if I was using selenium,
 * theres no point of selling it if it's this easy to make a ShoePalace selenium script.
 * This posed no challenge to me at all. Anyone that is learning about Selenium can easily replicate this in a better fashion.
 *
 * Auto checkout is not complete. I haven't even began working on it. 
 * Next push to the repo should have it. 
 * 
 * Yeah if you think I stole any part of this project, LOL what you gotta say, compare your project to mine you fucking skid
 * Shame that people are selling selenium based scripts in the first place.
 * 
 * 
 * Message me if you have any questions. I will respond to your questions. 
 * After I'm done with this project, I am working on a private script using Puppeteer. 
 *

 * Todo:
